# Quick Improvement Suggestions

## ðŸš¨ Immediate Fixes Needed

### Code Issues
- [x] **Duplicate `close_db()` method** in `library_service.py` (lines 466-476 and 477-485) (Fixed: Removed duplicate method)
- [x] **Missing import** in `run_gui.py` - `tk` is used but not imported (line 27) (Fixed: Added missing tkinter imports)
- [x] **Unused variable** in `app.py` - `mpd_music_dir_abs_path` is set but `final_mpd_music_dir_str` is used instead (Fixed: Removed redundant MPD path handling)

### Configuration Issues
- [x] **Empty API key** in `playlist_maker.conf` - should have placeholder or instructions (Fixed: Added example format)
- [x] **Missing MPD music directory** in config - could cause path resolution issues (Fixed: Set to match library path)

## ðŸ”§ Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Impact)

### User Experience
- [x] **Add version check** - Display version in GUI title and CLI help (Fixed: Version now shown in CLI description and GUI title)
- [x] **Better error messages** - More descriptive error messages for common issues (Fixed: Added helpful bullet points for common errors)
- [x] **Input validation** - Validate file paths and API keys before processing (Fixed: Added validation functions with helpful error messages)
- [ ] **Progress indicators** - Show progress for long-running operations

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Add docstrings** - Missing docstrings for several methods
- [ ] **Type hints** - Complete type annotations for better IDE support
- [ ] **Constants** - Move magic numbers to constants file
- [ ] **Error codes** - Standardize error codes and messages
